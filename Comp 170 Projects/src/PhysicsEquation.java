Assignment: Chapter 2A Assignment 2 - Chapter 2 Exercise 1 - Physics equation
Purpose of Program:
In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position
of a body in linear motion at a given time , based on its
initial position , initial velocity , and rate of acceleration ,
is the following:
s = s0 + v0*t + 0.5at^2
Write code for this assignment to declare variables for s, t, s0, v0, and a,
then use Console to get input from the user to give a value for each of the variables t,
s0, v0, and a. Finally write a Java statement to compute s, and display the result.

Algorithm:
1.

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        double s, s0, v0, a;
        System.out.println("Enter a value for time (t):");
        System.out.println();



    }
}
